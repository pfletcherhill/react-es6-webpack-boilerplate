# React ES6 Webpack Boilerplate

Extremely lightweight boilerplate for kick starting a project with the following technologies:

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [Babel 6](http://babeljs.io)
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) for bundling
* [Webpack Dev Server](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html)
* [React Transform](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr) for hot reloading React components in real time.

The various webpack options used have been explained in detailed as comments in the config file. Should help with understanding the nitty-gritty :)

### Usage

Start by creating a `.env` file in the root directory.

```
PORT=5000
```

Then run (if you're using yarn):

```
yarn
yarn start
```
